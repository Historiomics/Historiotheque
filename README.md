### HISTORIOTHEQUES ALL ACROSS THE LAND
*The Birth of The Concept of The Distributed Art-History-House*

__I. THE HISTORIOTHEQUE__
- The [Historiotheque](https://historiotheque.ca/) is essentially a design concept for an “Art House” that is similar to a kind of “Historical Society” all the while being an “Art Studio” containing its own “Archive”;
- The Artist or Artists working in the Historiotheque produce innovative cultural artifacts which they sell on the Art Market as well as maintain an archive of the history of the Historiotheque, as well as the history of the environing locale where they are situated;
- The concept of Historiotheque comes from the Greek ἵστωρ (hístōr, “witness”) and θήκη (thḗkē, “box, chest”), essentially making it a Witness-Box;
- The main idea is that Historiotheques in the plural would be distributed across geographical space, acting as a new kind of cultural institution which is a rich place with lots of cultural activity, cultural innovation, as well as history, historiography, and archival practices;
- Other cultural institutions can have archives; National Archives ARE archives, Historical Societies can HAVE archives, as can Museums and Galleries, the main difference with the Historiotheque being that it is also an active STUDIO SPACE, where cultural artifacts are being produced;
- What makes it a “Witness-Box” is that it serves as a kind of “window” into a specific time and place, i.e. the Historiotheque works from the ground up, it leverages the historical, geographical, social, political, and economic environment in which it is situated.

__II. THE FUNCTION OF THE ARCHIVES OF THE HISTORIOTHEQUE__
- It is very important that each Historiotheque also maintain an active Archive;
- The Art Operators of each Historiotheque maintain the archive, meaning that they continuously turn to it for inspiration for new cultural innovations, all the while maintaining it in its most efficient form;
- Often the Art Operators have to remove things from the archive, for fear that it become unmanageable; they keep only the bare essentials;
- Each Historiotheque therefore keeps a “living archive” of its entire history up until the present, as well as preserving the history of the environment surrounding it;
- In this way, Historiotheques help bring VALUE to the spaces that they occupy, putting each place’s history front and center, again, as a sort of “window” into a place’s “Historiome”, i.e. the shape and form of its unique “history” (and “historiography”);
- Art Operators at The Historiotheques work FROM THE ARCHIVES, meaning that they use the archives as a stepping-stone towards creating new, innovative works of cultural production;
- The Archive provides inspiration for new works;
- The Archive is an essential, fundamental part of the concept of the “Art-History-House” that is The Historiotheque, being what differentiates it from just a plain, old, vanilla “Art Studio”;
- And what differentiates it from a Historical Society, Museum, Gallery, or National Archive is that it is an active art studio; you get the best of both worlds with The Historiotheque.

__III. HISTORIOTHEQUES DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE LAND__
- The fact that MANY Historiotheques could be spread across geographical space means that every given place could have its own unique “Art-History-House” or Historiotheque, preserving the locale’s unique cultural history;
- The different archives of the different Historiotheques, as well as they unique studio spaces, could be connected together as a “Network-of-Historiotheques”;
- It is understood that this is similar to how primitive Churches began spreading across the land; the main difference is that the Historiotheque is a 100% SECULAR INSTITUTION;
- The concept of “Witness-Box” could also be said to resemble the concept of Tabernacle or Tent of the Congregation, but again it is entirely SECULAR (and also not really mobile, though mobile Historiotheques could be a working part of each Historiotheque, if the Art Operators wanted this);
- The Historiotheque is maintained by artists and other stakeholders who “operate the Art Operation” that is housed in the Historiotheque;
- It can be a “one-person shop”, as has been my own personal Historiotheque for at least the last 15 years;
- These distributed Historiotheques would also be open to the public, at least in part, i.e. people could visit the art studios and consult the archives;
- By keeping most of its production IN THE ARCHIVES, the Historiotheque creates a kind of “scarcity”, which should increase the value of the cultural artifacts it creates, on the Art Market;
- A new “Market-for-Historiotheques” could be created, once the concept is being realized across enough geographical space, in great enough number;
- Altogether the “Distributed Network-of-Historiotheques” would serve again as a “window” but this time into the “Global History-in-the-Making”;
- We call this global history-in-the-making “The Historiosphere”;
- The Historiosphere NEEDS Historiotheques distributed across time and space; they are the engines of cultural innovation and expansion; they preserve the documentary heritage of every given place where they are instituted, and together as a global, distributed network, they help preserve the “Global Documentary Heritage” of humankind;
- This is still only a design concept; I’ve been “operating” my own unique Historiotheque, and the Art Operation and Archive it houses, for at least 15 years (at least since the design concept first arose as The Historiotheque);
- Search online or on social media sites for the term __*#historiotheque*__ if you want to see content being produced by my Historiotheque.
